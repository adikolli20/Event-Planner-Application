# Event-Planner-Application
Describing the organization:
I want to create an online – platform that will be used from all people who are planning
to organize an event such as: weddings, birthdays, parties and so on. There will be two
main parts included in this platform: the customers and the businesses. A customer will
find different services and products through this platform such as: restaurants,
photographers, hairdresser, clothes, cars, flowers etc. On the other hand are
businesses that are going to advertise their own work through this platform. Each of
businesses included will have its own profile in which will post their work and a brief
description for themselves. There are going to be even some “planner”. There are some
persons that will contact with customers once they are unsecure. Planners will suggest
some different companies included in the platform for a specific service based on the
reviews that these companies have had during last years. Finally, there will be a
payment option. Once a customer decide for a specific service, he is going to pay online
for it. There will be several payment methods available such as: MoneyGram, PayPal,
Western Union etc.



The scope of this platform is to give the opportunity to everyone to organize its own
events in the best way possible in no time. If someone is busy and does not have a lot
of time to spend for finding the perfect photographer, this platform will give him/her the
opportunity to book him in no time while having a coffee break. Through this platform
everything will be clear and secure. So, once the customer and the business will agree
they will sign an online contract in which will be included the signature of both parts and
the conditions that they agreed. In such way, when the date of the events comes, there
will be no place for exploitation or misunderstanding. In this way, everything will be
easier for clients to choose their favourites businesses and not to lose time. Also, the
platform will make sure that all photos and videos that will be unloaded from the
businesses will be unique and will not belong to any other company. In this way there
will be no opportunity for a customer to get deceived.
